This Pointer:
-------------
1. Special pointer points to the object on which we're making the fn call.
2. Used in chaining of fn calls on objects.
3. Constant pointer so can't be changed.
class Point{
    int x, y;
    public:
        Point(int x, int y){
            this -> x = x;
            this -> y = y;
        } 
        Point &setX(int x){
            this -> x = x;
            return *this;
        }
        Point &setY(int y){
            this -> y = y;
            return *this;
        }
};

int main()
{
    Point p1(10, 10);
    p1.setX(5).setY(5); // calls made in chained fashion on the same object.
    return 0;
}
