Virtual Functions:
------------------

1) Base class's pointer or reference can refer to derive class object.
2) This helps in collection and management of data of all the derived classes using base class's pointer. 
3) By default fn calls are made based on the type of base class type used.
4) To circumvent this issue we use Virtual Functions.
5) If we state base class's fns as virtul then specific fns according to the referred derived object would be called now.
6) This is function overriding,  thus run time polymophism.
7) Class contains vptr, which points to a table containing all the virtual function lists.
8) According to particular derived class apt table is referred.
9) We add override keyword to derived class's functions.
