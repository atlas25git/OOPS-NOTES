Intro:
------

1. Classes are data types which have functions, of their own.
   Object is a variable of class.
2. Array type based programming becomes cumbersome.
3. Common methods could Inherited, thus saving code rewriting.
                        ----------
Constructors:
-------------
1. Same name as class.
2. Does intialization code.

Encapsulation:
--------------
Puts related data and functions together.

Private members could not be accessed outside the class.
The essence of them is performing sanitization checks on class variables.
As through members it could be processed pre emptively.

Abstraction:
-----------
Hiding internal details.

Polymorphism:
-------------

1. Same name but diff fnl signature.
    Static : Default arguments.
    Dynamic: Overriding in inherited classes.
             Virtual Functions.
             Function call varies depending on the caller class.
